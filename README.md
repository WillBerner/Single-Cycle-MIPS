This ia a Single-Cycle MIPS Processor designed throughout my COMP 541 class. It can handle most standard MIPS instructions, with some caveats such as jal, jr, etc. 

It comes with reset, but no error handling capabilities. All written and verilog, and demonstrated with an ASM program I wrote to mimic Pong (I call it futsal, the sprites are Chelsea and Man U with a soccer ball).
