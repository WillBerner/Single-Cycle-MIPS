A Single-Cycle MIPS Processor designed throughout my COMP 541 class.

Designed on a NEXYS 4 FPGA, and can handle most standard MIPS instructions, with some exceptions such as jal, jr, lui, etc. 

It comes with reset, but no error handling capabilities. All written in verilog, and demonstrated with an ASM program written to mimic Pong.
