This ia a Single-Cycle MIPS Processor designed throughout my COMP 541 class.

It was designed on a NEXYS 4 FPGA, and can handle most standard MIPS instructions, with some exceptions such as jal, jr, lui, etc. 

It comes with reset, but no error handling capabilities. All written in verilog, and demonstrated with an ASM program I wrote to mimic Pong (I call it futsal, the sprites are Chelsea and Man U with a soccer ball).
